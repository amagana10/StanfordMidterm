(2a) Compute the value of each of the following Java expressions. If an error occurs during
any of these evaluations, write â€•Error on that line and explain briefly why the error
occurs.

5.0 / 4 - 4 / 5					1.25
7 < 9 - 5 && 3 % 0 == 3			false
"B" + 8 + 4						"B84"



(2b) What output is printed by the following program:
/*
* File: Problem2b.java
* --------------------
* This program doesn't do anything useful and exists only to test
* your understanding of method calls and parameter passing.
*/
import acm.program.*;
public class Problem2b extends ConsoleProgram {
public void run() {
int num1 = 2;
int num2 = 13;
println("The 1st number is: " + Mystery(num1, 6));
println("The 2nd number is: " + Mystery(num2 % 5, 1 + num1 * 2));
}
private int Mystery(int num1, int num2) {
num1 = Unknown(num1, num2);
num2 = Unknown(num2, num1);
return(num2);
}
private int Unknown(int num1, int num2) {
int num3 = num1 + num2;
num2 += num3 * 2;
return(num2);
}
}

The 1st number is: 78
The 2nd number is: 73
